## **TaskMaster-AI** 

is a prototype of an intelligent task management platform designed to empower employees by aligning task selection with individual skills and interests. It integrates AI to promote engagement, uncover hidden talent, and optimize team performance â€” aiming to support both personal growth and organizational efficiency.

This project was developed as part of the **IBM Hackathon Program**, leveraging IBM Cloud technologies and Granite AI models to explore innovative solutions for the future of work.

> **Note:** This project is currently under development. The frontend and AI components were built separately as part of an MVP. Full integration between the interface and backend AI features has not yet been completed.

## Current Project Status

-  Frontend interface developed separately (React-based MVP)
-  AI/ML features (task recommendation, RAG architecture, duration prediction) prototyped
-  No full integration between frontend and backend yet
-  Future goal: connect all components into a seamless application

---

## Key Features (Planned)

### For Employees
- Visual task board with AI-estimated difficulty (green = easy, red = hard)
- Mandatory task highlighting (purple)
- "Top choice" task recommendations
- Suggested learning resources
- Progress tracking
- Feedback submission with auto skill updates

### For Managers
- Dashboard with performance metrics
- Task contribution summaries
- NLP-based feedback insights
- AI-assisted task creation and alignment
- Suggestions to improve team efficiency

---

## AI Capabilities (Prototyped)

- RAG-based task recommendation system
- Task description generation using IBM Granite AI
- Feedback-based skill inference
- Learning resource suggestions via embedding search
- Task duration prediction using time series simulation
- Hidden talent detection from historical task data

---

## MVP Demo Overview

The MVP highlights some standalone features:

- **Frontend**: Employee task view with static AI indicators
- **AI Models**: Independent prototypes for task recommendation and NLP feedback
- **Machine Learning**: Duration prediction visualizations
- **Demo Video**: [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJq-1khWvOI)

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML (MVP)
- **Backend**: Python 
- **Database**: SQLite (Planned)
- **AI/ML**:
  - IBM Granite AI
  - HuggingFace Transformers
  - FAISS (for RAG)
- **Versioning**: Git + Git LFS
- **Data Source**: Simulated datasets generated using IBM Cloud (Watson Studio )

##  Future Vision

Our long-term goal is to build a human-centric, AI-powered task management system that:
- Enables task autonomy
- Promotes skill development
- Surfaces hidden strengths
- Enhances organizational performance
